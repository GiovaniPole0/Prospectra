Welcome to Prospectra, where your journey to exchange your stablecoins for altcoins without paying fees begins, through decentralized loans! We are an innovative platform that offers a solution to unlock locked staking. Imagine investing in an altcoin that quickly rises by 80%, but your funds are stuck in staking. At Prospectra, we connect those who want to unlock these assets with those willing to exchange their stablecoins (such as USDC, USDT, DAI, etc.).
 


How does it work for everyone?
 

If you want to exit staking, Prospectra offers a simple way to unlock your assets and profit immediately by receiving stablecoins to sell them. And for those lending their stablecoins with the intention of exchanging them for altcoins, there's an advantage too: by lending USDC, USDT, or DAI to Prospectra, you earn interest in the chosen cryptocurrency, calculated based on the agreed-upon rate and the currency's value at the time of the loan. This way, you earn more altcoins instead of paying fees when converting them on an exchange. In summary, at Prospectra, everyone has the opportunity to profit.



For those looking to exit locked staking

With Prospectra, users can unlock their assets from locked staking in any cryptocurrency and receive USDC, USDT, or DAI instantly, while maintaining the flexibility to optimize their portfolios as needed. For example, imagine an investor has $10,000 in Polkadot and suddenly the value of this cryptocurrency rises to $13,000. In this scenario, by using our platform, the investor can realize their immediate profit. After signing the smart contract, they will receive approximately $12,708.80, taking into account the fees paid to the USDC, USDT, and DAI lending provider, and to Prospectra itself.

Staking Rewards After Signing with Prospectra


Users who choose to exchange their tokens in locked staking will receive all accumulated rewards during the period their cryptocurrencies were staked, up to the date they sign the smart contract.

Upon acceptance of the contract, the cryptocurrencies will continue to be staked according to the unlock period of the blockchain in question.

However, the value of staking after signing the contract, at the end of the specified period, will be directed to the platform, while the user will receive all accumulated rewards. For example, if the user staked their tokens for 100 days, they will receive the corresponding earnings for that period. Profits accumulated after signing the contract will be retained by the platform.


For those looking to lend USDC, USDT, and DAI in exchange for interest in cryptocurrencies.


The received amount is calculated based on the interest rate and the loan's date, providing an additional advantage. By opting for our platform, users avoid the fees associated with exchanging their USDC, USDT, or DAI for another cryptocurrency on exchanges. For example, if they exchange 100 USDC on an exchange, they end up receiving less than 100 dollars of the cryptocurrency they converted to, due to the fees involved. However, on Prospectra, by lending 100 USDC, they can receive back a higher amount, like 130 USDC in the agreed cryptocurrency. This offers a significant benefit compared to traditional exchanges.


Return Calculation

Example: Polkadot (28 days): The return is calculated based on the agreed interest rate and the currency price on the day they agreed to the loan.


For those lending USDC:
 

Amount loaned: $13,000.

Agreed interest rate: 0.08% over 28 days.

Daily return from the loan: $13,000 * 0.08% = $10.40.

Total return from the loan after 28 days: $10.40 * 28 = $291.20.

Total amount received by the lender: $13,000 + $291.20 = $13,291.20.

Quantity of Polkadots received: $13,291.20 / $10.71 â‰ˆ 1242.50 Polkadots.

Fee charged by Prospectra:
 

Initial total amount: $13,000.

Prospectra service fee: 0.08% over 28 days.

Total fee charged by Prospectra after 28 days: $13,000 * 0.08% * 28 = $291.20.


For those exiting staking:
 

Initial total amount: $13,000.

Total fee charged by Prospectra: $291.20.

Final amount received by the person exiting staking: US$ 13.000 - US$ 291,20 - US$ 291,20 = US$ 12.417,80.


Lending to the PAAS:


Users lend their USDC, USDT, or DAI to the PAAS in exchange for interest in the cryptocurrency they have decided to lend through the smart contract.
